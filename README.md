# Bored At Class RPG
a solo rpg i made just to have something to do during class when something interesting isnt happening, if you wanna play, then sure, i cant stop you, just be aware of the fact that its not good
if you have any ideas on how to make it not bad, then tell me in any way you find acceptable (maybe help with the stuff in [todo](./todo))
